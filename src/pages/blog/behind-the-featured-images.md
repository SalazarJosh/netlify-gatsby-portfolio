I remember way back in 2004 showing off a Morrowind mod that I was working on to a group of people that couldn't care less. I think back and cringe at 13 year old me, but that passion is what brought me to where I am today.

Growing up in the middle of a corn field didn't provide me a lot of opportunities to socialize with kids my age. The Morrowind mod was something I worked on all summer. The mod started out simple, but as I dove into this new world of game development I found myself exploring everything possible.

Part of that exploration led me to the free 3D modelling software, Blender. I believe I wanted to create some custom models for the castle mod that I was building. Similar to everything else I was learning, I didn't know the first thing about 3D modelling.

Several early 2000's 480p YouTube tutorials later, I finally had a decent model going. I loved the fact that I could create something from nothing and have the user interact and experience it, so I continued exploring 3D for several more years.

When I got to college I didn't know what area I wanted to focus on in game development. This is at a time when game design programs weren't commonplace programs for undergraduate higher education. I decided it really didn't matter so I picked computer science. It took about 2 years before I realized I didn't like it before I switched to graphic design. 

The humnan-centered aspect of UX Design was the exact reason I fell in love with game design. 

After graduating with my undergraduate degree I applied and was accepted to Southern Methodist University's Guildhall game design program. It was a small cohort with a very small acceptance rate. I was honored to be amongst the few selected for such a program.

After ariving on campus and meeting some of my cohort, I quickly learned this might not be the best thing for me. 

I made it through my undergraduate degree by funding it with personal loans and money out of pocket. I had no financial assistance at all. Every other person I interacted with at SMU was there thanks to money contrinbuted from their parents.

After SMU presenting me with ~$15,000 of technology and software on my first day, I became a little overwhelmed. I knew I'd have to pay this back with interest. So I left.
