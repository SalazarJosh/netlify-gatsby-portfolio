I'd like to take a break from my usual posts and share something a bit more personal. I love what I do professionally and I equally love the personal freedom this profession grants me.

We got into sailing sometime in 2021. An awesome neighbor invited my family out to a day of sailing and we immediately fell in love. We spent much of the summer and fall sailing and swimming on Baseline lake. I took part in my first regata late in sailing season. It was the last regatta of the year. The temerature was brisk and the water was even colder. The regatta is rightfully called The Bonechiller. View more information such as the results and additional photos on [the Michigan Sailing Club website](https://michigansailingclub.org/2021-bonechiller-regatta/).

Special thanks to Dr. Michael Austerberry [for taking the photos](http://michigansailingclub.org/2021-bonechiller-regatta-photos/).

I hope you enjoyed this break from my usual content. I think it's important to disconnect and have a healthy habit away from technology. I find it helps prevent me from burnout. Sailing is also a great activity that the whole family can enjoy.
