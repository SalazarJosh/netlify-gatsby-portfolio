This is a private write-up for thinking through an issue for GitLab's Pajamas Design System as part of my application for a [Senior Product Design position](https://boards.greenhouse.io/gitlab/jobs/5936071002). I'm only sharing this private link with the hiring panel and manager(s) for the position as part of my application. I really appreciate GitLab's open and collaborative approach to their platform. In the spirit of that, I thought this write-up would bode well with the hiring team.

<strong>To the hiring panel: </strong> I want to thank you for taking the time to review my application for the Senior Product Design Position and I also want to thank you for following along with my write-up. This write-up will walk you through my thought process of acclimating myself to the Pajamas Design system and navigating GitLab's documentation as part of thinking through a specific issue (I'll <em>try</em> to keep it fun and entertaining). 

## Context

To set some context, I am coming into this work completely unfamiliar with GitLab's Pajamas Design System. As a new user to the design system, this is a great opportunity to contribute my unbiased opinion. Admittedly, I am not following any sort of user research best practices in my decision making. I'm forming my own professional opinion on a specific issue and doing what I think is the best solution. I am following this route because I feel this is the best way to represent my work and experience as an individual contributor.

I am also unsure how long the position has been live so I would like to complete and submit it before the position is filled.

üòÆ‚Äçüí® *whew, let's get started!

## Setting Up

To start, I had to familiarize myself with the position, GitLab, and the Pajamas Design System. I spent some time around the hustle and bustle of Easter weekend going through the GitLab Design System documentation and familiarizing myself with Pajamas. I went through the issue tracker to find an issue that I would like to contribute to that didn't already have significant ground work completed. That's when I settled on [this responsive table states issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1282).

I like this issue because it will allow me to not only show my design and UX work, but also my coding ability and attention to accessibility. Given accessibility is mentioned ten (!) times in the posting, and given accessibility is a large portion of my day-to-day work, I really wanted to emphasize this in my work. 


### Sidebar
And this is where it gets a bit meta. At this point I needed a bit of a break to let all this information settle in. So, in the meantime, I decided to get this blog set up and plan my execution. 

As with all the blogs on my website, I always start with a low-poly 3D render for the thumbnail image. GitLab's logo is already following this polygonal design. Thank you for making this easy for me!

<div class="columns is-mobile widealign">
<div class="column is-6">

![Wireframe view of GitLab logo in Blender](/img/sidebar-inline-1.png)

<p class="has-text-centered"><small>Wireframe view of GitLab logo in Blender</small></p>
</div>
<div class="column is-6">

</div>
</div>

The [color palette](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/colors) and [press kit](https://about.gitlab.com/press/press-kit/) came in handy while creating this scene. The most challenging part was accurately capturing GitLab's color palette while also trying to light the scene with colored lights. Colored lights always influence the color of materials unless you overpower them with neutral source.

For the final render, I wanted to have a bit more color in the scene because the edges of the mesh felt sharp and unrealistic. I didn't want to use bloom as I didn't want a consistent glow effect on the entire image. Instead, I used a few point lights around the scene to illuminate and simulate a bloom effect on only a few parts of the model. I like how it turned out. 

## Exploring the Table Issue

Okay, back to work! In exploring the [responsive table issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1282), there's an [example of a table where the number of columns begins to negatively impact the display of the table](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/category-health/).

In the Resources section of the issue, there's an example of [a responsive table](https://adrianroselli.com/2017/11/a-responsive-accessible-table.html) that changes layout on smaller screen views. 

### Pros
It's a great solution in that it helps accomplish a number of issues
- First, it's agnostic of the number of columns. It'll move all columns to a row-like format to display the content.
- No information is cut off. You do not have to rely on two-dimensional scrolling to get all the content.
- Edd S, the author, carefully considered accessibility as shown in [their supporting slides](https://speakerdeck.com/edds/what-even-is-a-table-a-quick-look-at-accessibility-apis?slide=67). 


### Cons
- The display of the content is different between mobile and desktop. This requires the user to relearn the UI if experiencing both views.
- The title of the table becomes the table head. Though it looks great, this is not semantically proper.
- It is a bit over engineered. It requires JavaScript to recreate the table for a specific view.
- This write up was created in 2015, technology has changed quite a bit since then.
- Does not consider multi-dimensional tables

Here I try to outline what elements of the table move and where they move to:

![Showing how content has to move around the table for mobile view](/img/table-issue.png)

That's a lot of moving content. I feel like this approach is a bit over engineered and I can find a more responsive and accessible solution. The solution here may be pretty simple, horizontal scrolling.

Let's go to the drawing board ...

## Table design in Figma
I cloned the Pajamas component library Figma file to begin exploring options. In the Table component page, I duplicated the table a few times to have several different options to play with. Pajamas does not do any customization to the scroll bar so, to start, I recreated the default Chrome scrollbar and applied it to the bottom of the table.

![a table screenshot with a horizontal scroll bar](/img/table-responsive-example-1.png)

Great! This solution will allow me to use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for the most accessible experience. I can also use [webkit to allow overflow scrolling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/-webkit-overflow-scrolling) on mobile, but I can do a bit better.

From a UX standpoint, I can still see an opportunity for improvement. 

In the example screenshow I show above, there are additional columns outside of the view. Currently, the only indicator that there are additional columns is the scrollbar. Chrome on mobile, by default, will not show the scrollbar until you interact with the table. If the table happens to be perfectly positioned to cut off columns, the user may not know to scroll over to view more content.

There needs to be an additional visual cue to ensure users know there is some content off screen. I added a subtle gradient to the edge of the table that could help accomplish this:
![a table screenshot showing a subtle gradient cue for overflowing content](/img/table-responsive-overflow-2.png)

If the user begins scrolling, I can fade this gradient in on the other side to show there is content outside of the view on both sides:
![a table screenshot showing a subtle gradient cue on both sides of the table for overflowing content](/img/table-responsive-overflow-1.png)

## Design Accessibility Considerations
This proposed solution works well in that it's responsive and agnostic of screen size.

The subtle gradient indicators that imply more content is out of view help those that may not have a scroll bar visually present. It's another subtle indicator to reinforce interaction without infringing on the visuals of the table.

This method will rely on native, semantically correct HTML to allow screen readers to natively integrate with the display of the table. I won't need to reinvent a table layout for mobile.

## Implementation
To showcase my frontend experience and meet the criteria of the following requirement in the job posting, I'd like to share how I would implement this solution with consideration to the limitations of frontend technology. 

<em>"You understand frontend code and the limitations of frontend technology. You can demonstrate this through hands-on coding skills with HTML/CSS/JS/Vue, experience with Git, or by showing a deep understanding of the needs of engineers you've worked with previously."</em>

Given the core framework is built on Bootstrap, I'll also use Bootstrap to implement my suggestions. First off, here's the final table:

<div class="spacer-sm"></div>
<iframe height="620" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Untitled" src="https://codepen.io/joshsalazar/embed/LYeMJva?default-tab=" frameborder="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">
  See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/joshsalazar/pen/LYeMJva">
  Untitled</a> by Joshua Salazar (<a href="https://codepen.io/joshsalazar">@joshsalazar</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.
</iframe>
<div class="spacer-sm"></div>

The table is no longer constrained on the x-axis. Adding Bootstrap's ```table-responsive``` class allows me to achieve that. It appears the front-end is built on Bootstrap v.3.4.1 so [responsive tables are available](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/#tables-responsive). The ```table-responsive``` class adds an overflow-x property and sets it to auto. This allows it to confine intself to the space of the parent and overflow the content into a scroll. 

On the same ```table-responsive``` class, I'm applying some css to make the gradients to indicate overflowing content.

<pre style="background-color: #eee; padding: 15px; margin: 1.875rem 0;">
<code>background-image: 
    linear-gradient(to right, white, white), 
    linear-gradient(to right, white, white), 
    linear-gradient(to right, rgba(0, 0, 20, .20), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)), 
    linear-gradient(to right, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0), rgba(0, 0, 20, .20));
  background-position: left center, right center, left center, right center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-color: white;
  background-size: 20px 100%, 20px 100%, 10px 100%, 10px 100%;
  background-attachment: local, local, scroll, scroll;</code></pre>

In short, this code is creating four background images. Two images are simple white boxes and two images are the dark linear gradients. Those linear gradients are bound to the edges of the container but the two white boxes are set to the outer bounds of the nested content (in this case, the edges of the table). When the user scrolls to one end of the table, the white box will overlay the linear gradient. This effect will indicate the end of the content by hiding the gradient.

Applying this code to the table on the example from the issue, we can start to see it in action:

![a table screenshot showing the results of this work on the example page](/img/table-responsive-final.png)

## Implementation Accessibility Considerations
Semantically, the table is fairly simple. I'm using the ```scope``` attribute to help screen reader users by announcing columns and rows, but there are a few more things I can do to increase the usability of the table. As the tables become more complex, more table attributes such as the headers (with associated ```<th>``` id), colspan, etc. can be used. ARIA roles, properties, states, and tabindex attributes can also be [implemented into the table](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/table/table.html).

## Final Thoughts
I began exploring max-height tables to further enhance the experience of the tables. One issue I often experience with long tables that have horizontal scrolling, you have to scroll to the bottom of the table to find the scroll bar, then scroll over, then scroll back up to the content you wanted to view. I can fix this by making sure the table views are constrained to a user's viewport by setting the ```max-height``` of the table to roughly ```75vh```. That way, no matter what screen you're viewing the table on, you can always pan in two-dimensions without having to navigate to the bottom of the table. 

This would be a great example where UX research could help identify all use cases prior to starting design ideation.

I was also a bit hesitant to showcase my code implementation. I do not consider myself to be a frontend engineer, though I am proficient in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I hope the code implementation adequately met my goal of showcasing my understanding of frontend technology without taking the spotlight away from the design and UX considerations that I feel will be the focus for this role.

If you've made it this far, thank you again for taking the time to follow along. Though this example is fairly simple, I hope it adaquately showcases my excitement and ability.

<strong>Have a great rest of your day! üëç</strong>
