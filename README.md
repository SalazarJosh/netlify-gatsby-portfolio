# Gatsby + Netlify CMS Portfolio Site

**Netlify Deploy Status:**
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/baad14b3-b0f7-4364-a485-ab30fce41380/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gatsby4portfolio/deploys)

This repo is my personal portfolio build with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and deployed with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org): 

**[View Website](https://joshuasalazar.net/)**.

## Resources
This website uses:

- [Gatsby v4](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/gatsby-4/)
- [Netlify Starter](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms#readme)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for CI/CD, and CDN distribution.

## Notes
Though I can do development work, my speciality lies in design. As such, my website is built with a design-first approach. I started the design in Figma before building.

The theme of the website is low-poly. It acts as an homage to my background in 3D and game design and I think it works well for my code/design personal brand. Every blog post has a custom 3D rendered designed in Blender for the feature image. I try to keep the low-poly aesthetic for those while also bring bold and vivid color.
